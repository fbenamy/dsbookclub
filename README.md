__A cohort-based reading group for people data scientists and statisticians.__

One day I realized that I wanted to read a text book and that a friend in the field also wanted to read that text book, and his friends as well. Thus an idea was born to try and create a cohort-based reading group to read a text book. 

The text book in question is __Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath (second edition)__. (He also has videos from the course in lecture form is you're more of an auditory learner: https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019)

The group hasn't officially started yet, but once we get rolling, the format will be a suggested reading pace of 2 chapters a week with an every other week virtual "book club" session. 

The unofficial start date is the Monday, August 31st. 

If you are not interested in joining the slack, but are interested in the discussion sessions, you can shoot me an email at faith.benamy@gmail.com. 


You can join the slack here: www.codeforphilly.com/chat?channel=dsbookclub (you'll need to sign up with the Code For Philly workspace). 

I'm going to keep updating this document and posting to the slack with more details and we finalize who is joining the group. Discussion questions for the virtual book club will be posted in this repo. 

The time it took me to read each chapter is listed below to help you plan. These estimates do not include the "Practice" section
