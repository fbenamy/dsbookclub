__A cohort-based reading group for people data scientists and statisticians.__

One day I realized that I wanted to read a text book and that a friend in the field also wanted to read that text book, and his friends as well. Thus an idea was born to try and create a cohort-based reading group to read a text book. 

The text book in question is __Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath (second edition)__. (He also has videos from the course in lecture form is you're more of an auditory learner: https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019)

The suggested reading pace will follow the 10 week course, but each reading group can choose their own adventure. 

The official start date is __September 8__, the day after Labor Day in the US. 

There's a slack with a channels for each individual channel to discuss each chapter. 
Please fill out the google form to get a link to join the slack. 

I'm going to keep updating this document and posting to the slack with more details. Discussion questions suggestions for the virtual book club will be posted in this repo.
